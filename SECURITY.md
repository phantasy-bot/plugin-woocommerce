## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Phantasy seriously. If you believe you have found a
security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly.

### Please do NOT:

- Open a public issue on Forgejo or GitHub
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed
- Exploit the vulnerability beyond proof-of-concept

### Please DO:

- Email your findings to **security@phantasy.bot**
- Include the exact version, git tag, or commit if known
- Include whether the issue affects the default localhost quickstart, a shared deployment, or both
- Include detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Include the impact of the vulnerability
- Include any potential fixes if you have them

### What to Expect

| Timeline   | Action                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 48 hours   | Initial acknowledgment               |
| 7 days     | Detailed response and assessment     |
| 30-90 days | Fix released (depending on severity) |

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- Provide a more detailed response within 7 days
- Work on a fix and coordinate the release with you
- Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted consistent with this policy to be authorized and will not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith.

## Security Best Practices

When using Phantasy:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique secrets for production
   - Rotate API keys regularly

2. **Authentication**
   - Always enable authentication in production
   - Use strong passwords (we recommend using the password hash generator)
   - Enable rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Treat the localhost quickstart bootstrap login as temporary scaffolding only
   - Do not switch quickstart runtimes to non-loopback hosts, shared origins, or public exposure until the bootstrap admin password and auth secrets are rotated
   - Treat admin access as operator-level host access when developer tools are enabled
   - Keep `developer-tools` disabled unless every admin user is trusted with local file and terminal access
   - Shared/public `developer-tools` exposure should require `PHANTASY_ALLOW_SHARED_DEVELOPER_TOOLS=true` in addition to the normal advanced-module opt-in
   - Treat `Developer`, `Workbench`, and `Test` as operator-only surfaces, not shared tenant UI

3. **Convex system storage**
   - Set a dedicated `PHANTASY_CONVEX_DEPLOY_SECRET` on both the host and the Convex deployment; do not reuse the workflow API key as the deploy secret in production
   - Keep operator JWKS (`JWKS` / `CONVEX_SITE_URL`) on the host so Convex Auth password login can verify tokens
   - Use `PHANTASY_WORKFLOW_API_KEY` only for Convex→host machine callbacks, not as a client or integration API key

4. **API Keys**
   - Store API keys securely (use environment variables or secret management)
   - Never expose API keys in client-side code
   - Use different keys for development and production

5. **Updates**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Apply security patches promptly

## Security Features

Phantasy includes several security features:

- Convex Auth password login for the operator shell
- Project source control integrations (Forgejo and GitHub) — not the admin door
- Rate limiting and account lockout
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Deploy-secret gated host→Convex writes
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration and per-integration origin checks
- Security headers on all responses
- Audit trail coverage for host-side workbench command execution
